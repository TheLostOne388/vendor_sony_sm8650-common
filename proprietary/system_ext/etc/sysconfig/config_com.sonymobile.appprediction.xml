    <!-- These are the standard packages that are white-listed to always have internet
          access while in power save mode, even if they aren't in the foreground.

         An example of white-listed is following:

         <allow-in-power-save package="com.example.a" />
          - The packages that are white-listed to be able to run in the
            background while in power save mode.
          - The packages that are white-listed to be exempted from Background service
            restriction after Android O.

         <allow-in-power-save-except-idle package="com.example.b" />
          - The packages that are white-listed to be able to run in the
            background while in power save mode.
            (but not whitelisted from device idle modes)
